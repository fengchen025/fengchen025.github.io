My name is **Feng Chen (陈丰)**, and I am currently a PostDoc in Machine Learning associated with [VIOS Collab](https://vios.science/) at the **University of Edinburgh** and [PhenomUK](https://phenomuk.org/). I work closely with [Prof. Sotirios A. Tsaftaris](https://vios.science/) and [Dr. M. Valerio Giuffrida](https://www.valeriogiuffrida.academy/wp/). 

My research focuses on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) for natural sciences**, with a particular emphasis on:
- Large Language Model (LLM) agents
- Computer Vision and Deep Learning
- Weakly-Supervised Learning
- AI applications in Plant Phenotyping

Previously, I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/cvl/) at the **University of Nottingham**, under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew P. French](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/cvl/people/andrew.p.french) and [Prof. Tony Pridmore](https://people.cs.nott.ac.uk/psztpp/).
